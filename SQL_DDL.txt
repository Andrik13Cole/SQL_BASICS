1. Create a new table containing the category code and description 
for the categories of books sold by JustLee Books. The table should be called CATEGORY,
and the columns should be CatCode and CatDesc. 
The CatCode column should store a maximum of 2 characters, and the CatDesc 
column should store a maximum of 10 characters.

CREATE TABLE CATEGORY
(Catcode VARCHAR2(2),
Catdesc VARCHAR2(10));


2. Create a new table containing these four columns: Emp#, Lastname, Firstname, and
Job_class. The table name should be EMPLOYEES. The Job_class column should be able
to store character strings up to a maximum length of four, but the column values shouldn’t
be padded if the value has less than four characters. The Emp# column contains a numeric
ID and should allow a five-digit number. Use column sizes you consider suitable for the
Firstname and Lastname columns.

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES
(Emp# NUMBER(5),
Lastname VARCHAR2(15),
Firstname VARCHAR2(10),
Job_class VARCHAR2(4));


3. Add two columns to the EMPLOYEES table. One column, named EmpDate, contains the
date of employment for each employee, and its default value should be the system date.
The second column, named EndDate, contains employees’ date of termination.

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEES
ADD (ENDDATE DATE);

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEES 
ADD (EMPDATE DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE);

4. Delete the EndDate column from the EMPLOYEES table.

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEES
DROP COLUMN ENDDATE;

5. Create a new table containing these four columns from the existing BOOKS table: ISBN,
Cost, Retail, and Category. The name of the ISBN column should be ID, and the other
columns should keep their original names. Name the new table BOOK_PRICING


CREATE TABLE book_pricing (id, cost, retail, category)
AS (SELECT isbn, cost, retail, category, FROM books);


6.  Delete the BOOK_PRICING table permanently so that it isn’t moved to the recycle bin.
Delete the JL_EMPS table so that it can be restored. Restore the JL_EMPS table and
verify that it’s available again.


DROP TABLE book_pricing PURGE;
DROP TABLE jl_emps;
FLASHBACK TABLE jl_emps TO BEFORE DROP;
